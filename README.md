## blackjack rl repo

I'm just looking to play around with some AI reinforcement learning within this project. I have a simple blackjack game that I've created and I'm looking to create a few reinforcement learning agents to play the game.

## how to run:

```shell
pipenv shell

# run the main.py file
python main.py

# run the training module
python train/main.py
```
